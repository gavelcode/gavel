# MCP Server Integration

Gavel exposes a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
server that gives LLM agents read access to your quality gate configuration,
findings, coverage, and architecture rules. The server runs on stdio and
delegates every operation to the `gavel` CLI binary.

## Prerequisites

Your Bazel workspace must already have Gavel configured:

```starlark
# MODULE.bazel
bazel_dep(name = "gavel", version = "0.0.0")
```

And the generated files from `gavel init`:

```
.gavel/
├── gavel.yaml           # project config
├── gavel.bazelrc        # aspect registrations
└── gavel.MODULE.bazel   # tool dependencies
```

## Claude Code

Add to `.claude/settings.json` (project-level) or `~/.claude/settings.json`
(global):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gavel": {
      "command": "bazel",
      "args": ["run", "@gavel//apps/cli/cmd/gavel", "--", "mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GAVEL_WORKSPACE": "${workspaceFolder}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The first invocation compiles the binary (Bazel cache cold). Subsequent
invocations reuse the cached binary and start instantly.

## Other MCP clients

Any MCP-compatible client (Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, etc.) uses the same
command. Adapt the JSON to the client's settings format — the command and
args are identical.

## Exposed tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `gavel_judge` | Run static analyzers and evaluate the quality gate |
| `gavel_findings` | Discover all findings across a project, with by-rule summary and rule/severity filters |
| `gavel_lint_file` | Lint findings for a specific file |
| `gavel_coverage` | Extract coverage percentages |
| `gavel_validate` | Check workspace structural setup |
| `gavel_init` | Initialize Gavel in a workspace |

## Exposed resources

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `gavel://config` | Workspace configuration (`gavel.yaml`) |
| `gavel://projects` | List of projects with patterns and gates |
| `gavel://projects/{name}/quality-gate` | Quality gate rules for a project |
| `gavel://projects/{name}/baseline` | Baseline state (findings/violations) |
| `gavel://architecture` | Architecture policy layers and deny rules |

## Dogfooding (gavel's own repo)

In the Gavel monorepo itself, the CLI is a local target, not an external
dependency:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gavel": {
      "command": "bazel",
      "args": ["run", "//apps/cli/cmd/gavel", "--", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**Slow first start** — Bazel compiles the binary on the first invocation.
Run `bazel build @gavel//apps/cli/cmd/gavel` once to warm the cache.

**`GAVEL_WORKSPACE` not set** — The MCP server uses this variable to locate
the workspace root. If not set, it defaults to the working directory of the
`bazel run` invocation (usually the workspace root).

**Binary not found** — Verify the Gavel module is reachable:
`bazel query @gavel//apps/cli/cmd/gavel`. If using a local registry, check
that `.bazelrc` contains the `--registry` flag pointing to it.
